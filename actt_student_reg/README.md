## About the App

The **ACTT Student Registration App** is designed for ACTT Moshi to streamline the student registration process. The app includes the following screens:

1. **Starting Page**: The entry point of the application.
2. **Dashboard**: A registration form for capturing student details.
3. **Registered Students List**: Displays a list of all registered students.

### How It Works

- **Data Storage**: The app supports both online and offline modes for seamless operation.
- **Local Storage**: Submitted data is stored locally in JSON format for offline access.
- **Data Sync**: The locally stored data is synchronized with Google Sheets for sharing and long-term storage.

This approach ensures flexibility, reliability, and ease of access to the data.
